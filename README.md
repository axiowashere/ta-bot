discord bot that uses a selenium webscraper to access grades on teachassist.
the commented-out code could be used to create REST API which could be accessible by front-ends making it modular for desktop software, and apps
- the API is compatible with TA-4

the actual scraper took 30 minutes but trying to deploy the project took 5 hours and my joy out of ever doing a hackathon again

cheers to samuel lu for giving me his yrdsb credentials for me to verify the functionality of it
cheers to samuel lu again for reminding me not to post my discord token on a public repository
